# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Microsoft Excel was one of the first programs to integrate spreadsheets with charts and graphs. Excel is a great tool to visualize, manipulate, and evaluate data. With the analytical tools available in Excel, a user can analyze significant amounts of data to uncover trends and patterns that may impact a projects' decision making. In this project, we analyzed a data set consisting of over 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.

### Purpose

In this project we will sharpen our Excel skills by applying several techniques that would allow us to organize and manipulate data incredibly fast. From using conditionals to help users better visualize relative data, to carrying out extremely complicated forms of statistical analysis, Excel can increase productivity in the workspace exponentially. It is one thing to store and manage large quantities of data, but it is another to discover relationships hidden among the lines.

## Analysis and Challenges

There were several notable pieces of analysis. Let us discuss two of our findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
